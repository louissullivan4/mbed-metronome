# mbed-metronome
Use the mbed to create a metronome, using the Ticker. A minimal solution should have 2 buttons, one to increase the rate and the other to decrease the rate, in increments/decrements of 4 beats per minute. Use the buzzer and an LED for the ‘tick’/flash.The beat period should be displayed on the LCD screen. Include a facility to play “concert A” (440 Hz), or another pitch, to allow the musicians to tune their instruments.
